            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In the words two things considerable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A precept, <hi>Let your speech be alwayes with grace:</hi> that is, whatsoever speech you have with your neighbours, especially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, let it be savoury, and with grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118411:4"/>2. The end of the precept, that you may know how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer every man, according to the divers dispositions and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is it to have the speech <hi>with grace, powdered with salt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. That our speech be savoury, not idle, unprofitable, or obscene; but holy, harm less, relishing of a principle of grace, from within; so that as salt drawes out putrifying humors out of meat, and makes it relishable for the palate, and fit for digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so a principle of grace in the heart should offer to the tongue holy and savoury discourse, and should suppress rotten and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy conference. Hence two rules are in the text: 1. It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>with grace,</hi> that is, relishing of the grace of Christ in the heart, for speech without grace relishes no more then meat without salt: <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.16. To the wicked sayes God, <hi>What hast thou to do to take my covenant in thy mouth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It must be <hi>powdered with salt,</hi> that is, with the salt of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent holiness; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Ye are the salt of the earth.</hi> 2. The salt of the Word, which was signified by that <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>With all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt,</hi> that is, the salt of the Word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant by this word <hi>[alwayes] alwayes with grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Constancy of holy language, some (when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong good persons) will speak godlily, as <hi>Jehu, Balaam, Saul;</hi> but in other company talk wantonly and foolishly: We ought to speak holily, not onely when we are on our sick beds, and in godly company, but also at other times.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Perpetuity, that we speak not well only by fits, but let it be the usual practice of our whole life: carnal men, though good words may now and then drop from them, yet are they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tired therewith, more then Saints are with wicked discourse, because of the remainder of corruption in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This word <hi>[alwayes]</hi> intends other Christians as well as the Colossians, whose duty it is to look to their speech, that it be winning, and edifying, not hardening, or corrupting, and that the constant purpose of their hearts tend hereto, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I said I will take heed to my wayes, that I offend not with my tongue.</hi>

I will not with <hi>Ambrose</hi> condemne all jests; for God having given us a power of laughing, hath given us objects, and occasions of laughter, but biting jests, which delight some, and offend others, and sinfull jests, which make a mocke at sin; <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.9. And Scripture jests, which mocke at the holy word of God, are prophane, and abominable. Though a Christian may now and then breake an harmeless jest, yet is it no praise for a Christian man to be a jester, for usuall jesting brings a man into a light frame of spirit, so that the soule cannot feed upon serious things.</p>

But because at such times we seldome remember Gods name, therefore it is better to change our salutation into other phrases, as, <hi>I am glad to see you, how do you, your servant;</hi> farewell; the learned languages use such salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the Greeks use <gap reason="foreign">

Idle talkers, condemned <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. <hi>Of every idle word that men shall speak, shall they give account.</hi> An idle word is a profuse, or needless word, used rashly, or unadvisedly, wanting a reason of just necessity, bringing neither honour to God, nor edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to speaker, or hearer, nor conducing to any profitable end. Many persons are guilty herein; as,</p>

Unseasonable talkers, that place one word, where another should stand, their words are like misplaced words, and letters in a Printers presse, which marre the sense, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.4. <hi>A wise man discerneth time and judgement;</hi> He meanes it of a seasonable admonishing of a Prince.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Rash talkers, who speak first, and think afterwards; <hi>Herod</hi> rashly promised to give <hi>Herodias</hi> what she would aske. <hi>Be not rash, with thy mouth, Eccles.</hi> 5.2. God hath set a double bar to the tongue, the teeth and lips, that we should not speake rashly, words once spoken cannot returne, when once spoken they are no more thine, but the hearers; A man that thinks before he speaks, seldom repents of what he speaks; silence is far better then rash speaking.</p>

Every one that doth well, hath as much right to his good name, as our selves, thou art not able to judge of other mens actions, as being ignorant of many circumstances therein, for thou knowest not with what minde he did it, nor to what end; holy men are much in judging themselves, and sparing in censuring others. Be sparing in censuring; if we censure other mens evills, let the evills be evident, and to warne others, not to cause joy in our owne estates, by looking on other mens falls, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4: <hi>Let every man prove his owne works, that he may have rejoycing in himself alone, not in another;</hi> that is, not in another mans fall.</p>

Backbiters; some backbite others out of lightness and bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, having no intention to wrong, this is the less, but it's so much more, when persons out of a spirit of hatred backbite others; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tongues are like sharp razors, <hi>Psa.</hi> 52.2. yet may we in love speak of other mens faults to them who have power to reforme them, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> told his Father his brethrens faults, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. pretend not for your slander that the thing is true, for it was true that <hi>Doeg</hi> told <hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>Abimelechs</hi> releeving of <hi>David;</hi> but because <hi>Doegs</hi> intent was to make <hi>Saul</hi> think that <hi>David</hi> conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, therefore he was a slanderer. Be carefull seldome to speak of other mens faults, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.2. And when thou hearest thy neighbour slandered, it's thy duty to maintaine, and justifie his innocency; by thy silence herein thou becomest guilty of slander. It was a good counsell of one to backbiters, when they backbite for that which is good, say, nay rather this person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be commended, and you bring a woe on your selfe, for calling good evill; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.20.

This is the common evill of the times, exceeding destructive to humane society in general, and friendship in particular, for the whisperer separateth very friends, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Liars; lying is a voluntary in equality betwixt the heart and speech, when a tongue shall affirme things to be true, which the heart knowes to be false, or to be doubtfull or uncertaine; opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and reports, must be affirmed, as they are, and not spoken for certainties. Yet tropicall speeches, as <hi>Metonimies, Jronies, Metaphors,</hi> and <hi>Sinechdoches,</hi> and <hi>Allegories,</hi> for as much as they are invented to teach both with more pleasure, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, are not lies; being very frequent in the holy Word, see <hi>Amos</hi> 4.5. 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 6.6.119.36. No more are parables, and similitudes, being not only used in the old Testament by holy men, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.7. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.15. but even by Christ
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118411:8"/> himselfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20.21.22. &amp;c. Nor to lie hid in general speeches, when a man is not sifted to particulars, is no lie. How prone are our tongues to lying? so that the Spirit doubted not to call <hi>every man a lier, Rom.</hi> 3.4. Yea it hung upon <hi>David,</hi> when he was in the highest pitch of regeneration, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.29. Take from me the way of lying, yet are the lies that flow from Saints upon suddaine surprizal, seldom or never upon deliberation; so that a Christian will no more deliberately lie, to save his life, then he will steale or deny Christ delibarately, to save his life, and therefore if thou hast a purpose to deny any evill formerly acted, by thee, when in time to come charged upon thee, I may groundedly question, if not positively deny, thy regeneration, thou maiest refuse to answer to the question, or put the questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner off with other truths, or show a distast of their curiosity, but thy purpose must bee to incur rather shame and blame, nay death it selfe rather then deliberately to lie, for we are to chuse affliction; rather then iniquity, <hi>Job</hi> 39.21. And true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant soules have their purposes set against all sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.18.</p>
                  <p>But because there are diverse cases, wherein persons are apt to lash out in lying, as to gratifie a friend, the Hebrew Midwives lied to save the males alive, <hi>Exo.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Rahab</hi> lied to preserve the spies, <hi>Jos.</hi> 2.5.6.2. To beaveng'd of an enemy, thus <hi>Act.</hi> 6.11 <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.60.61.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For pious ends; as, 1. To advance Gods glory, <hi>Job</hi> 13.6.7: <hi>Will you talke deceitfully for God?</hi> 2.

                  <p n="4">4. For mirth, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.3. The Prophet blames those who made the King and Princes glad with their lying mirth; if Princes who by reason of their government are most opprest must not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed with lying stories, or jests, much lesse must any other man.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. For advancement of our owne gaine, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.6. the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seeke death. No man can tell how apt the tongue is to flie out in this case, but they that have watcht their hearts: <hi>It's naught, saith the buyer, Pro.</hi> 20.14. this helpt on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphiras</hi> lying, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. and <hi>Judasses, Joh.</hi> 12.6.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For escaping some Crosse, persons are apt to lie, to shun reproach, imprisonment, banishment confiscation of goods, and death, remember that of <hi>Psal.</hi> 56.7.

                  <p n="9">9. In case of pretended modesty, and humility, so many will deny the gifts, and graces of God in them. Many assert those things in words, which they meane not, to gaine the opinion of an humble person, that of less then the least of all Saints differs from that of the Roman Antichrist, who calls himselfe the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Servants of God,</hi> but indeed intends to rule over prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                  <p>To remedy that proneness that is in us to lying, speake neither more nor less of thy selfe, or any thing else, then it is; our tongues are made to be significations of our mindes, and not to lie is an act of power, for God cannot lie, not because he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118411:9"/> but because he is omnipotent. If thou comest to any stature in grace, thy heart will smite thee for this sin in speciall, and thou wilt hunger and thirst after truth, and mourne for it, which babes in Christ do not so much note.</p>
                  <p>Contrary, consider the gloriousness of truth, which is most beautifull when most naked, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. Now that is truth which is what it seemes to be, and that is false which seemes that it is not; as <hi>Iehu,</hi> who spoke that he had a great sacrifice to do to <hi>Baal,</hi> when he intended to destroy the <hi>Baal</hi> worshippers. The <hi>Priscilianists</hi> in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, held that the Soul of man was of the substance of God, that a man might lie for the saving the Soul, or body of another, that a man might deny the truth he beleeved, if he kept the truth in his heart, so that when they were among <hi>Catholikes</hi> (as they cal'd them) they would speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Priscilianists,</hi> and when they were among <hi>Priscilianists,</hi> they would speak against <hi>Catholikes.</hi> One <hi>Consentius,</hi> and diverse others, who were Catholiques, would faine themselves to be <hi>Priscilianists,</hi> that they might discover these <hi>Priscilianists,</hi> and bring them back to the Catholique faith; or if incorrigible, turne them over to the Magistrate; <hi>Augustine</hi> writing hereof to <hi>Consentius,</hi> one of the chiefe of them, praised his Zeale, but his manner of prooceding he flatly condemned, saying, <hi>how can I persecute lies, with lies?</hi> Moreover, as the Sun is light without darkness, so is God truth, without falsehood, whose truth is the measure of all truth in the creature, for the commonest truth that is, as to say that <hi>Jesus is the Lord,</hi> is not but <hi>by the Holy Ghost; Rom.</hi> 12.3. As all lies spoken though by Saints, proceed from the Devill, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. So all truth spoken, though by a wicked man, proceeds from the Holy Ghost.

Some men are so contentious in words, that if you bring the most demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative arguments in the world, they will not obey the truth, nor give over the error; of such see <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8. It's our honor to fall down before truth: if others be fire, pray that thou mayest be water to quench them. Imitate <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 11.1. to vers. 18. who when charged by the circumcision brethren for eating with the Gentiles, he gave a reason of his so doing in meekness, with which the circumcision brethren were so satisfied, that they held their peace, and glorified God.

I will not say simply, that all worldly words are unlawful, when spoken on the Sabbath, for if they be, then if a man come and ask me a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether I will go to <hi>York,</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> or any other place, or if he speak any other worldly question, though never so short, I must reprove him, and say I am not to speak a worldly word this day; for I am to chuse any cross, rather then sin against my conscience, in committing any iniquity: For, suppose speaking a worldly word were but a little sin, yet doing it against my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and conscience, it's an heynous sin, and going on against my principle and conscience, with the repetition of many acts, it's a question whether such a principle be consistent with saving grace. Therefore however the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith, cap. 58.13. that we must not speake our own words on the Sabbath day, yet being there is an end put to that Sabbath, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. (for if the old Jewish Sabbath, or the seventh day from the creation, be not there put to an end by God, God having once commanded it, it ought still to stand, but it seems to me there to be put to an end) and seeing there is a change of the worship to the first day of the week, now to affix all the duties of a day that is changed or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, to another day that is appointed instead of it, without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118411:15"/> command from God, which here is scarcely producible, I see no convincing reason; the day that we observe now for worship, the Holy Ghost calls it the Lords day, and so it is of divine authority.</p>
                     <p>For to answer to that place of <hi>Esay,</hi> the Prophet neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined silence on that day, nor secondly did not universally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid a worldly word, but.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Esay</hi> understands it of such words as answered to their wicked will, which formerly he had condemned in the preceding part of this Chapter; he enjoines them not onely a cessation from deeds of their owne carnall desires, but also from words thereof.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> So the Lord doth, but he forbids them then especially, when we have opportunities for an holy Communion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Worldly words are so far forth unholy, as they put us out of an holy frame of heart on that day, for we ought to have our hearts holy before hearing, and praier, and holy after; yet if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man shall ask me a worldly question before the Ordinances, or betwixt them, or after them, I should not scruple briefly to answer him, yet would I get rid of him as soone as I could, lest by a continued discourse my heart should grow carnall.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In refraining from all worldly speech, look upon thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frainment as a matter of expediency in order to a spirituall good, not as a matter of necessity, as if thy speaking some few worldly words were sin.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. The lesse thou speakest of any worldly thing on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, the more spirituall thy heart is like to; bee and therefore, he that can refrain altogether, doth best.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Beware of carnal conference, that it bring thee not into a carnal frame of heart; for it is a sure rule, that the frame of thy heart ought to be sutable to the duties thou art conversant about. To conclude this point, many Christians rashly receiving this principle, that now on the Lords day we must not speak any
<pb facs="tcp:118411:16"/> of our owne words, that is, words of common business, walke nothing according to this rule, but sin grievously against their conscience, and by this principle come to have a slight opinion of sin, because they do so commonly sin on the Lords day, by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their owne words, whereas it is the duty of Christians to chuse any crosse, rather then so deliberately, and continuedly to sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord.</p>

                        <p>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;</p>
                        <p>Though he spare it, and forsake it not, but keep it still within his mouth:</p>
                        <p>Yet his meat in his bowells is turned, it is the gall of Asps within him.</p>

                  <p>THe foregoing words are <hi>Zephars</hi> answer to <hi>Iob,</hi> the sum of the foregoing verses, together with the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is to shew the miserable condition of a wicked man: he begins the discourse, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. and sets it down po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively.</p>
                  <p>Two things against this are objected, 1. <hi>Verse</hi> 6. That wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men have a great deal of glory and excellency here on earth: to which he answers, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9. He shal perish as dung, as a dream, and his posterity shall be forced to restore what he hath unjustly got: and further, that these evils do for the present fill his bones with putrifaction and rottenness, and hereafter they shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
                  <p>A second Objection is, that wicked men have a great deal of sweetness and pleasantness in sin, to this he saith, true, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what these sweet sins will be in time to come. They will be to him, as if he had drunk a cup of poyson, or as if he had been bit with a viper, vers. 14.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:118411:22"/>
                  <p>In the words two things; 1. The present sweetness sinners find in sinfull ways, set down by sundry Metaphors; it's like a piece of Sugar in his mouth, which a man holds close under his tongue, or in the midst of his palate, as <hi>Vatable</hi> reads it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he spares it, as we do those we love, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He forsakes it not; as when we love a person or thing, we will not forsake that person or that thing, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.17. <hi>Ruth</hi> would not forsake her mother <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>omi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The future bitterness of sin, seen in two Metaphors, 1. It's like meat turn'd in the bowells, which though very sweet in eating, yet when the stomach hath digested it, and separated the impure from the pure, it becoms as bitter as it was sweet before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's like the gall of Asps it afflicts his soule as a cup of the strongest poyson doth the body, when it is drunk down.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Obs. <hi>Wick d men, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve their soules joyned to any sin, they relish it sweetly, and favour it tenderly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obs. <hi>Darling sins, though very sweet for the present, will one day be very bitter to the spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obs. <hi>Wicked men, that have their hearts joyned to any darling sin, they relish it sweetly, and favour it tenderly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things. 1. What a darling sin is: 2. Why the hearts of wicked men are so joyned to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is. It's a secret sin, proceeding from some inward corruption, and furthered by some sutable temptation, whereby the heart rejoyceth in some lust above, any thing, fearing and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every thing that may rob him of his lust: wherein observe, 1. It's a secret sin, persons hide it in their bosome, <hi>Iob</hi> 31.33. No man shall know of it save conscience, no not conscience neither, if a man can possibly by any tricks and distinctions keep it off. <hi>Gehezi,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 5. <hi>Achan, Ios.</hi> 7.19, 21. as <hi>Rachel</hi> hid her fathers images, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.34.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It arises from corruption within, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.8. and some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tentation without, Satan without, and corruption fill the heart, so that some lust is exalted above God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.2. Satan put it into <hi>Iudas</hi> heart to betray Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The heart delights in it. As the Saints delight in God and his Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. So do wicked men delight in some evill, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.14. Now as all delight and joy in any good thing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118411:22"/> arises from love to it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.47. So it is in evill things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The seat of it is the heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31, 32. A mans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expressions may be quite contrary.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The soul rejoyces in it above all other things; rather then <hi>Herod</hi> will let <hi>Herodias</hi> go, he will part with <hi>Iohn,</hi> yea with half his kingdom. <hi>Haman</hi> will give 10000. talents but he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the Jews. Though <hi>Balaam</hi> seemed to have some tast of the powers of the world to come, in that he desired to die the death of the righteous, yet had he rejoycing in <hi>Balaks</hi> gold above all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The soul fears and hates every thing that may take away the lust; what we love, we fear that which may rob us of it, as we love life and goods, we fear sicknesse and robbers that may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyl us of them; so men that live in sin, they fear powerful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and books that may reveal what is not consistent with truth: so they hate what may take away their lust. Ask them what they ayle, and they will say as <hi>Micas</hi> did to the men of <hi>Dan, Iudg.</hi> 8.23, 24. <hi>Why, you have taken away my gods. He that doth evill hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. Ioh.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why their hearts are so joyned to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas</hi> 1. Because they think they see some apparent good in it; good either reall or apparent is the object of love: the worldling thinks ther's some wisdome in being covetous; the proud man thinks ther's some good in being cap'd and cring'd to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but did sinners see the curse and the heavy doome in future, they would not be drawn to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because of the daily satisfaction a deare lust brings to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, there are daily incomes of profit and pleasure, you know how men are affected to those things that come in that way; <hi>Demas</hi> left <hi>Paul,</hi> and embraced the world, because he saw the world pleased his palate, and procured him ease and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the cross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because every darling lust is a mans idol, it's his God, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts it above God; as the Saints relish God and his presence sweetly, so do they their lusts, they give them the chiefest seat in the soule, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.8. They set up their idols in their heart, from these God takes soules, when he brings them home to him,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118411:23"/>
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>From all your idols will I cleanse you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse. Inform.</hi> See why persons are so loath to leave their lusts, a man that hath a peece of sugar in his mouth would be loth to part with it when he tasts the sweetness; so these men are loth to leave their lusts of uncleaneness, lying, worldliness, pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because of their sweetness, that which <hi>Naman</hi> said in another case, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 5.18. they say, <hi>in this thing the Lord pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. See why we need not wonder that wicked men are so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, why because their hearts have such delight in that which is contrary to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Dehortation;</hi> To take off wicked men from their sweet lusts, as anger, pride, revenge, or one of these two rocks must dash their soules, either they hear of some duty, and they will not close with it, or else are warned to part with some sin, and they will not part with it: Now to dissuade us from living in sin, or embracing these sweet sins, consider these seven things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thy sparing some darling sin, it will be thy destruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. It will be with us as with <hi>Saul</hi> in sparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and the best of the cattel, for which God cast him off, 1. <hi>Sam</hi> 15 or as the Prophet told King <hi>Ahab,</hi> for sparing King <hi>Benhadad,</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.42. because thou hast let go a man whom I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to death, thy life shall go for his life: by sparing this thy sweet lust, thou wilt undo thy selfe. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n do with their darling lust, as <hi>David,</hi> did with <hi>Adonias,</hi> 2. <hi>Reg</hi> 1.6. none might displease him or aske him why he did so. Loth would we spare an enemy when if we let him alone, wee knew he would kill us. Oh let us be advised not to spare a deare lust, least it kill us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. So long as thou sparest any sin, and livest therin, thou art not in Christ, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>he that is in Christ sins not</hi> (in purpose or allowance, for else every man sins, 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.46. <hi>Eccles</hi> 7.20) but thou art of the devill, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. and not borne of God, vers. 9. <hi>whosoever is borne of God sins not; i.e.</hi> reservedly, approbatively, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving or approving any sin, he never laies aside his purpose of repenting, never laies aside the habit of faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he intermit the acts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So long as thou sparest any sin, thy religion is no better then mere nature, no man but will obey God in somthing, and abhors some vices, because there is a disproportion betwixt them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118411:23"/> and this naturall inclination; or mere atheisme, when a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves there is a God, he will serve him according to his prescript, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all oppositions of pleasure or paine; or else mere hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, in that we do many things, but not all, or else mere presupmti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilest we know such a thing to be a sin, yet will do it, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.30. how dangerous is it when mercy that should lead us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, leads us to sin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If thou sparest one sin, thou canst not have a conjunction with God: God is compared to a jealous husband, that will not indure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be loved before him; that one sin hinders this conjunction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares <hi>Esa.</hi> 59.1.2 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.4. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.15. <hi>There's no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betwixt light and darkness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. So long as thou livest in one sin thou art not upright with God, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.24. nor is thy praier, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.18. nor person acceptable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. but God remaines thine enemy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.21.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So long as thou sparest one sin, thou endeavourest to serve two masters, commanding contrary things at one and the same time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. one master onely can be obey'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. if thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customest thy selfe to do evill in any kinde of wickedness thou canst not do well, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. One sin thus spared is an eminent signe of death, 1. <hi>Joh</hi> 3.16. if thou lovest not thy brother, a mortall wound and life cannot stand together, no more can a living lust, and spirituall life, now that is a living lust which though now and then we have fits of resistance, yet wee cherish it and say it's our nature, and so spare it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But I do not live in sin, I know it's dangerous and therfore I hope all is well with me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> If thou livest in a purpose of sin, or an omission of a known duty or unresolvedness against any sin, it is all one; what if thou dost not purpose to sin, yet dost thou purpose not to sin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But could I be convinced such a thing were a sin, I would not do it, or such a thing were a duty, I would do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol</hi> If the truths that are brought to thee bring convincible light and thou through carnall distinctions or winking against that light will not suffer it to convince thee, God will punish thee as if thou had'st had convincement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. <hi>they have closed up their eyes least they should see.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the not being convinced would beare a man out at the day of judgment, then no man almost would be condem'd; few Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists condem'd for Popery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">

                  <p n="2">2. An apology for the law against some cavils which some did raise from <hi>vers.</hi> 5. as if the Apostle should say, The law was the cause of sin and death; to which he answers, 1. The law prohibits and discovers it, therefore it causeth it not, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. 2. Distinguisheth 'twixt the cause &amp; occasion: the law is an occasion of sin; as wine is an occasion of drunkenness, and beauty of lust, not the cause, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. 3. Whereas we are liable to eternal death, it is not by the law, but by sin, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. onely the law shewed me my condition. From which answers the Apostle concludes, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. that seeing the law of it self neither brings forth vitious affections nor death, but that inbred corruption brings forth both; the law ought not to be accused, but rather we may hereby see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 13.</p>

The combatants, <hi>viz.</hi> inherent corruption, and inherent grace. 2. The complaints the regenerate man makes in respect of his corruptions, that it hinders him in all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended good, <hi>vers.</hi> 18, 19, 21. and furthers him in all his disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed evil, <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16, 19. the burthen so pressed him, that it makes him cry out, <hi>vers.</hi> 24. 3. The consolations, 1. That he did not allow the evil in himself, but hated it, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. 2. That his heart did close with the law, though in many things his practice failed, and he consented to the Law that it was good, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. 3.

                  <p>Quest. <hi>Whether doth the Apostle make this complaint in his own person, or in the person of another, describing some prophane or unregenerate man, or the nature of man since the fall, what it can do without grace?</hi>

                     <hi>Resp.</hi> As in the state of regeneration, 1. Because, to will a spiritual good, and to hate not this or that particular evil, but whatsoever evil ariseth in the heart, is onely proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men; but so did the Apostle, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because he hath an inner man, <hi>i. e.</hi> a principle of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, which is onely proper to regenerate men, <hi>vers.</hi> 22.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Because a regenerate man knows, that a holy frame of will is accepted of God in stead of deeds, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11, 12.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118411:29"/> that is, when a man can do no more then will, God accepts it for deeds; as in the widows mite, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.43.

Goats-hair was accepted towards the building of a Sanctuary, if a man could bring no better; but if he could bring Gold, Goats-hair was nothing. Though <hi>David</hi> could not build God an house, yet God saith, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.18. <hi>Whereas it was in thy heart to build an house to my name, thou didst well, that it was in thy heart.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="6">6. Because his understanding is inlightned to see good, therefore his will chuseth it; the object the will pitcheth upon, is something the understanding sees to be good, at least in appearance; as the choice of inordinate pleasures, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the understanding sees some good, though such an understanding is like a false looking-glass that presents not things as they are: hence, because a childe of God cleerly sees things that are good, his will is bent for the same.</p>

Our will to good, must be free, out of the exel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency we see in Gods waies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Earnest. John</hi> 4.32. As a hungry man goes to his meat, or a thirsty man to his drink, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.32. Now to run, a man must be earnest; if wicked men come to hinder, he is earnest in the pursuit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.115. if preferments or reproaches come to put the soul off from the object, it will not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. he chose to suffer affliction with a good conscience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is proportionable; as the good is greater, so must the will be enlarged. A childe of God hath a will for every thing that is good: but when it is some great good, then the heart is enlarged.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Determinate: <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.15. Many men approve things good, but dare not chuse them, for fear of crosses and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, or the aversness of the times: but it's otherwise with a regenerate will: Let me do my duty, though I go to prison, or lose preferment. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. they clove with <hi>a full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> Many a mans will for good, is just like <hi>Orpah,</hi> that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go along with her mother <hi>Naomi,</hi> but in a while kiss'd

                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p>Object. <hi>But how can we will any thing that is good? we are not able to think any thing that is good, of our selves,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>much less to will it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. We will when we will, but God makes us for to will. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. After he had bid us <hi>work out our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he addes, vers. 13. <hi>It's God that worketh in you both to will and to do.</hi> Yet when God hath wrought upon our will, our will doth co-operate. As my paper whereon I write, receives the ink passively, and brings nothing of its own to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; for I could have writ upon another piece of paper: but being written upon, it becomes an instrument with me of the writing; and as I write more and more, so it still co-operates with me, though in it self there be no natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the writing. So it is with the will of man in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version: though God might have pitch'd upon another will, when he wrought upon ours, yet ours being wrought on by him, doth co-operate; and as paper can make no resistance, no more can man's will. Not as if mans will had no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of resistance in it self naturally, but because grace takes off this resistance.</p>
                     <p>Now God in bending the will to good, doth it three ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By removing natural rebellion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By presenting unto us objects of good, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.15.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By inclining us to the choice of the good proposed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.36.</p>

                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118411:31"/>3 <hi>Use Consol.</hi> To the Saints that finde their wills for good. It was a principal comfort that stayed the Apostle amidst his infirmities. A holy soul can say, Lord, thou knowest the bent of my heart is for thee. As the creatures, being made alive, are able to produce living actions; so the will of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being opened, is able to open it self to God. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.</p>
                     <p>That which many say formally, a Christian says truly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it's in heaven.</hi> Neither do they stand in some of Gods will, as a wicked man may, but in the whole will of God. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But to what purpose is it for regenerate men to have a will for good, when they want power? What comfort can there be hence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> God looks upon true desires and willings, when a man is able to do no more. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.22. <hi>The desire of a man is his kindness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are not onely able barely to will, but also by the Spirit of God, which is a Spirit of liberty, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.) they are enabled to bring much of that they will into act. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.32. Though they cannot do so much as they will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their will is extended according to the latitude of the Law, but their performance is extended according to the measure of sanctifying Grace. The performance of God's people is something, their endeavours more, but their desires infinite. It is with Gods people in willing and performing good, as it is with a man that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">3. It is a great consolation to regenerate men, in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their performances, that they have a will turning from all evil, and closing with all good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 16, 17, 20. though corruption of nature be apt to hinder in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of the good willed, vers. 18. The flesh is an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent guest, that wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Though the will be so divided in it self, that it seems to go two contrary ways, being like a pot with two ears, on the one of which grace lays hold, and on the other corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. yet grace gets the upper hand of corruption. Every regenerate man hath as it were two wills striving in him together, like <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Rebekka</hi>'s womb, or the disease and the antidote in the body of a sick man: but yet, according to the promise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin shall not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over you;</hi> the regenerate will gets the mastery.</p>

                     <head>Motives to will what is good.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The excellency of the thing offered or proposed. Christ is good, and the Law good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>better then gold, yea, then fine gold,</hi> Psal. 19. If I should propose inheritances, riches, honours, and bid you chuse these, every man would be ready to chuse. O these are not to be compared with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, to have the heart brought into an universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods will, that the soul says, <hi>Father, not my will, but thine be done.</hi> Is not this an excellent object?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The freedom of will which believers have in the very first act of believing. Hence the Scriptures warn us to yeeld unto God when he calls us, to open to him when he knocks at our hearts, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.20. And else why should the Prophets and Apostles so tax us when we do not consent? <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. These three places, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, signifie, that the very consenting or working, the <gap reason="foreign">

The threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, promises, and precepts, signifie the same to us.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, before grace came to us, we were not onely like the wounded man that betwixt <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho</hi> was wounded, and left half dead, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.30. but we were whole dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.

                     <p>So that look as in natural men there is a willingness to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie men in their wills, <hi>Foelix was willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, and left Paul bound,</hi> Act. 24.27. &amp; 25.9.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Christians shall have these good things, and all other good things which they will, in Gods measure, and in Gods time, and so far forth as God sees it good.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The commanding power which the will hath over all the faculties and members, if that be gained to good, the tongue will speak of it, the ear will hear, the hand work, the desires and affections long for it; it's like some Garrison that commands the Country about.</p>

                        <hi>The fourth Use of trial whether you will good aright.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the readiness and nimbleness we have in doing good, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. the yoke of Christ is easie to those whose natures are regenerate: if it be to shew mercy, he can do it cheerfully; if it be to pray, he can rip up his heart bleedingly; if the Church be in distress, he can sympathize feelingly; as it was with the Centurions servants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Goe, and he goeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. When we do good with a love to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.15. <hi>It's a joy to the just to do judgement. Psal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I delight to do will.</hi> Carnal men do many good action, which might befit a Saint of God, nay an Angel of heaven; but they love not the good they do: shame of the world, cry of conscience, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of death, sets them a doing it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When we disallow the evil we do, not onely because the natural conscience condemnes it, but from a new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whereby the will and the law closes together; as in <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 16.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When ordinarily and usually the will stands averse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contrary commands, as a servant doth unto the commands of those that are not his Master, especially when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by secret sins, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. and by small sins. He that truely makes conscience of a little sin, doth much more make conscience of a great sin: so when the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118411:33"/> soul stands averse to sins of calling, sins of the times, which carry little or no dis-esteem, by reason of their commonness.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When in case of falling into any sin, thou art unquiet till thou hast recovered thy self, and returned unto thy wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience; as the point in the compass rests not till it come to the North: so <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had no rest in his bones, by reason of his sin: wicked men decline from good by degrees, and never be disquieted with it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When a man wills good, notwithstanding loss of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proposal of sufferings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 11.25. such a soul is willing to go thorow fire and water to do his duty. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.22, 23, 24. there were many troubles like to come upon him, as bonds and afflictions, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. and other troubles which he knew not of, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>but none these things move me,</hi> &amp;c. when duty to God bindes me, Many men that think their wills are for God, do their duty with this secret limitation, So far as it shall be free from personal danger: if there be danger, they fall off, like <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that told <hi>Beza, He loved to put no further to sea, then he could put in again in case the storm should rise.</hi>

                        <hi>Observ.</hi> Though regenerate men have a will to good, yet is there a remaining principle of corruption, which is cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them in their actions and services, even when they will good. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Now to understand this, consider, 1. That it is of sin in the reliques, not in the reign. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though these reliques of corruption do cleave to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man in his actions and services, yea, to his principal faculties, as his will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet his will doth not cleave unto them.</p>

                     <p>God will in the mean time have these reliques of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption left in us, 1. To exercise our graces, as faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, self-denyal, which are stirr'd up by the opposition of the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That we might long to be dissolved from this body of sin, and have a full deliverance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That God may crown the conquests of his Saints in heaven, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Reas.</hi> Because mortification is onely in part in this life: it is indeed in every part, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.23. as health is in a man that is begun to recover out of sickness; health is in every faculty and part, yet is there some reliques of his disease, though the state of health get ground of the state of sickness.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It appears from the contrary motions of the will; for the will cannot fight with it self, about the same Object, and be distracted into contrary parts; were it not that as by the habits of grace it's inclined to good; so by the reliques of sin it is driven to evil.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It appears from experience, in that we finde an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of corruption, 1. In things pertaining to God. 2. To our neighbours. 3. To our selves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In things pertaining to God, as 1. In assenting to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we are ready to draw a model of God according to our conceptions, not according to his nature: so in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the attributes of God, corruption cleavs to our belief of his power, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21, 22. so to the belief of his promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.13, 15.</p>
                     <p>So in the belief of the Trinity, the creation of the world, the incarnation, death and resurrection of Christ, the last judgement, the resurrection of the dody, faith and unbelief
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118411:35"/> is mixed in the same soul: <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. his tears and confession shews his faith, and his questioning, <hi>If thou canst do any thing,</hi> shews his unbelief. So the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> their faith stood in need of perfecting, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.10. What questionings had <hi>Asaph? Psal.</hi> 77.8. Many that think their faith strong, were it assailed with tentations, either to forsake enjoyments, or to endure suffering, they should see the weakness of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In practice: What weariness in holy duties! in prayer, <hi>&amp;c. Isai.</hi> 43.21, 22. So look in duties of the first Table: in our love to God, how doth self-love, love of the world, and pleasures adhere! in speaking of God's Name, what a want of reverence! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what excursions in prayer! what by-ends in following our calling! Rust not onely comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iron, but even upon purer metals, gold and silver: cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption not onely hangs on wicked men, but even on the Saints.</p>
                     <p>So in duties of the second Table. I might go thorow every Commandment: self-love is mixt with love of our neighbour, pride with humility, hypocrisie with sincerity, distrustful fears of poverty, in exercising acts of liberality.</p>

Hence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. Grace and Corruption are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to two Duellers, one of which fights against the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Corruption in unregenerate men, hath the guilt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death joyned to it; but in regenerate men, that groan under it, the guilt of it is taken away. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. after he had set down the combat and the complaint of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, he addeth, <hi>There is THEREFORE no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</hi> Hos. 13.14. Rom. 8.3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Corruption in wicked men is easie, and no burden; as the elements in their proper place are not ponderous; as a million tuns of water in the sea is not ponderous; but if you take a bucket-full out, it weighs sore. <hi>Fools make a mock of sin,</hi> Prov. 14.9. and <hi>it's an abomination to them to depart from evil.</hi> Prov. 13.19.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The example of the Saints: <hi>Abraham</hi> calls himself, <hi>dust and ashes, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was humbled under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of pride and unthankfulness, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25, 26. <hi>Paul</hi> groans under it, and calls himself <hi>a wretched man, Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Bradford</hi> from the remainders of hyporcrisie, calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>a very painted hypocrite. Job</hi> abborr'd himself in dust and ashes for the reliques of his impatience, <hi>chap.</hi> 42.6. <hi>Isaiah</hi> was a holy man, &amp; yet he saith, <hi>Wo is me, I am a man of polluted lips! Isai.</hi> 6.5. And <hi>Ezra</hi> from the sight hereof confesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself, as if he had been the grossest sinner in the world, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. The Prophet had desired God to be attentive to his prayer; saies God, Thou art a sinner full of inherent corruption, cleaving to thy prayer, and to all thy services: to which he answers, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldst be extream to mark what is done amiss, who shall stand?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The exceeding filthiness of it,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat is take occasion from the very command to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, <hi>v.</hi> 8. as in an <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> the more intense the cold is, the more the heat puts forth it self; so the more the law keeps in corruption, the more it rageth; as an angry dog, the more he is resisted, the more curst he grows: see <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:118411:37"/>2. In that there's no good thing in this unregenerate part. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I know that in me (that is, in my slesh) dwels no good thing.</hi> In the very devils there's some good, as their power, and their nature, which they have from God; but their will is from themselves: but here's nothing good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In that it maintains a constant war against the contrary principle of grace, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. So that the Saints of God are forced to fight with it from day to day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Ground.</hi> The close adherency of this corruption: It is not onely cleaving to every faculty, but to every grace; faith and unbelief, hope and despair, self-love to the love of God, where they contend together like light and darkness in the same horizon, or like heat and cold in the same water, or like health and sickness in the same body.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The continual disabling of us from doing the good that we would do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>To will is present, but how to perform that which is good, I finde not;</hi> if we call upon God, how doth it carry the heart out in fruitless excursions? if we would me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, how doth it present unholy and vain objects to us? if we are put upon the doing or suffering any thing for good, how doth it put us upon by-ends? It's like a sickness that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies a natural body: when the sick man thinks to eat, meat is brought to him, but he cannot; he thinks to walk, but his sickness disables him: he walks a turn, but lies down again.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Use of exhort.</hi> To endeavour the subduement of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining adherent corruption, that doth thus cleave to us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> two Grounds hereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It takes away our comfort in respect of the measure of it. When <hi>David</hi> was drawn away with his lusts and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruption, it kill'd his comfort, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.8, 12. How oft do these remainders cause the soul to question its estate: Am I God's, or no? is not this evil I do a reigning sin in me? So <hi>Peter</hi> after denial of Christ, he had no comfort, till Christ was fain to appear unto him after his resurrection. Saies the soul, I have prayed, but Oh the by-thoughts in it! I have shewed mercy, but Oh the smister ends in it! I have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods cause, but how little have I done it unto God? I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118411:38"/> have been a Preacher thus long, but how seldom have I preacht unto God!</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is ready treacherously to betray us to Satans tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: it's like a traiterous Governour in a Garison. So <hi>Davids</hi> pride betrayed him to Satan, when he provoked <hi>David</hi> to number <hi>Israel,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. As <hi>Dalilah</hi> did with <hi>Sampson,</hi> pleased him a little, that she might deliver him to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines;</hi> so the flesh pleases us, that it may treacherously betray us to Satan. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. he bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> forgive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous, <hi>lest Satan get an advantage: for we are not ignorant of his devices;</hi> so that as soon as a weakness is in a Christian, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan gets an advantage by it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5.</p>
                     <p>Now the tentations of Satan whereto remaining corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betraies us, they are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Tentations to sin: So the corruption in <hi>Peter</hi> betrayed him to Satans suggestion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16 when <hi>Peter</hi> being moved thereby, he counselled Christ to save himself.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Tentations to discouragement: When corruption breaks out in pride, and worldliness, and hypocrisie, and self-love, and inordinate affection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Satan will discourage Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and tell them, They will never be able to hold out to the end; but either persecutions or sufferings on the one hand, and the loss of some earthly enjoyment, or the strength of some corruption, will prove their unsoundness; and Satan takes advantage of their infirmities, to make them conclude they have no sincerity, no truth of grace in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Means to subdue the evil that cleaves to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Complain against thy self: Lord, I have so much pride, such passion and frowardness, so full of carking cares, dejecting sorrows, despairing fears, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. when pride, the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan, which he suggests from revelations, (as indeed <hi>In tentationibus carnis semper est aliquis consensus,</hi> saith <hi>Durandus) Paul</hi> falls to prayer again and again; he besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from him: in the end, God answers his prayer thus; <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> All that are weary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. are bid to come to Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t: now he that complains against himself, is weary. God sometimes defers
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118411:38"/> to hear these complaints, but it's onely that these infirmities may be more odious to the eye of conscience, &amp; that we may the more value the deliverance from them, when we obtain it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.10, 11. <hi>David</hi> complained against the uncleanness and crookedness of his own heart, though <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him, God had pardoned his sin. <hi>Isai.</hi> 63.17. How did Gods people complain of their own hardness of heart! for they were believers, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. So <hi>David</hi> also complains of himself, for a mis-apprehension of Gods providence in the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of earthly things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.21, 22.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Draw by faith healing power from Christ. <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.4. He that when he was on earth heal'd blindeness and deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, can he not now in heaven heal these? <hi>Isai.</hi> 35.5. Look as the wound draws a healing power from the medicine; so should we, being compast with remainders of sin, draw heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Christ against the remainders of malice, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we being by faith joyned to Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and made one Spirit, shall from this Spirit receive healing power; onely we must excite and actuate our faith, if we mean to have power from Christ derived to us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Watchfulness: When an army knows that they have not onely an enemy lying close against them, but even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves, they had need watch: this is our case: we have the flesh within us, in prayer, hearing, reading, to carry us to distraction; in suffering, ready to save our skins, though with loss of conscience; in works of mercy, to carry us to vain-glory; ready to carry the eyes to lustings, the ears to listen after unclean things, our taste to excess <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1. had we a pilfering servant, we would ever and anon have an eye upon him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Apprehend God's all-seeing eye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. how he sees every stirring of corruption in thy soul. This did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awe the remaining corruption in <hi>Job</hi>'s heart, chap. 31.1. compared with vers. 4. When inordinate affection springs up, say, Soul, darest thou do this, when God looks on? Say as <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 5.20, 21. The thinking that God sees not, hath been a principal means to strengthen corruption. <hi>Job</hi> 22.12, 13, 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:118411:39"/>5. Be perswaded of the exceeding sinfulness thereof: see it, in that it takes occasion to work sin and death, even by that which is good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 13. Besides experience, which is much herein, we stand in need of the Spirit to convince us hereof. 2. In that it gives all advantage to Satan: Satan could have had no power against <hi>Ananias,</hi> to fill his heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. nor against <hi>Judas,</hi> to enter into his heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.2. much less with <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vid,</hi> to have numbred the people, had it not been for this in-dwelling sin. Hence Gods people, in their confessions, never once mention Satan, but onely this corruption, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Use,</hi> to God's people, that still finde this corrupt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple assailing them from day to day, even when they will good: thus will it be in regenerate men, even when they have a will to good. Thus was it in <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 143.2. and 130.3. It should be a matter of humiliation, but not of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement: it should make us long to be at home with the Lord, but not deject us, that we become unfit for our journey. This is our comfort; though corruption steam out hellish mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, like a filthy dunghil; yet we resist them, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them, and the fountain whence they come. The more holy any man is, the more he loaths himself for this adherent corruption: as in <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Suffer dust and ashes to speak.</hi> So <hi>Isai.</hi> 6.5. and <hi>Job</hi> 42.6.</p>
                     <p>This is our comfort, That this Corruption is not in the reign, because our will is not for it, but for good; we disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it in the root and branch, in the fountain and stream: we hate it, and groan under it.</p>
                     <p>And for the reliques, this is our comfort, That we have a Physitian giving us a daily purge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. and that we are daily going towards a state of soundness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is renewed every day:</hi> which appears, because a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace carries a command over our wills, our wills over our affections, our affections over our actions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Consol.</hi> to Gods people in point of infirmities. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but many infirmities will be cleaving to them: then they fall to question whether they be God's children. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-regenerate
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118411:39"/> men, having such a corrupt principle, it cannot be but they must have many infirmities: As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In respect of God; as weakness of faith, of love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, knowledge, desire of communion with him. These and many thousands proceed from corruption: so that as he prayed concerning his faith, <hi>Lord, help my unbelief;</hi> so had we need to pray in all other graces, Lord I love, help my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, self-love.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Towards men, <hi>i.e.</hi> wicked men, whiles sometimes we strengthen them in their sins, by our uneven walking: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times insult over them in their unregenerate state, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>who made us to differ,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. In stead of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we too often laugh at them: in stead of walking wisely towards them, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.1. we too often corrupt them, and cause them to stumble, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. In stead of <hi>shining forth as lights,</hi> Phil. 2.14, 15. Matth. 6.16. there's much darkness in our paths: and all this is from our corruption.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, towards the Saints. Sometimes,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Against the Church in general; when we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in their happiness, and sorrow in their misery, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. so when we forget it in our prayers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122.6. so when we shall for fear of persecution mislead the people of God, as some of the Circumcision-teachers, <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But specially when corruption shall prevail so far, to carry us to some scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous practice, whereby all Gods people shall be branded for our sins; as <hi>David</hi> and the incestuous person did, and those <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.20.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Towards Christians in particular; as in want of charity to one another. If we compare our sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>erties of charity mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6. we shall see how corruption s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>raitens us: so in want of edifying by mutual visiti gs, as that of <hi>Mary</hi> to <hi>Elizabeth, Luke</hi> 39.40. by mutual provokings to good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118411:40"/> mutual conference, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. by mutual admonition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and mutual consolation, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17. mutual sympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.10. these infirmities are either in strong to weak, or in weak to strong.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In strong to weak: As when the strong shall draw the weak to do things against conscience by their example; as they that had knowledge, and went to their Idol-feasts, drew weak ones so to do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12. so when strong do not bear the infirmities of the weak, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1, 2. so when the strong despise the weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. and set him at nought, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. as God carries himself to such weaklings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. he doth not breake them nor quench them, no more must you. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Support the weak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So in censuring them for infirmities, when they know the constant course of their life to be holy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. Many make more of an infirmity in others, though they see the whole course of their life is truely to please God, then they make of gross sins in themselves, though they take no course to please God. This is a great corruption in many towards them that are different from them in judgement: condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In weak to strong: As when a weak brother judges a strong in an indifferent thing, as in case of eating or not eating; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. So <hi>Johns</hi> Disciples tax Christs Disciples for not fasting when they fasted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.14, 15. So for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of dayes, 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Let no man judge you,</hi> &amp;c. Weak Christians, through ignorance of Christian liberty, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through needless scruples, somtimes through unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taince with other mens wayes, may condemn things lawful and laudable in the strong.</p>
                     <p>So when weak brethren, through over-valuing themselves, undervalue others that are strong; so in some places new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts having got a little knowledge, put forth themselves too forwardly in company of the strong, and so hinder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others of benefit by conference. The weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Corinth</hi> undervalued <hi>Paul,</hi> which the Apostle tells them of in a continued irony: see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. These bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6. that seemed to be something, added nothing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118411:40"/> to <hi>Paul</hi> in conference. Humility and modesty well befit new converts, and a reveren e to the Saints of God, that were in Christ before them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Infirmities in respect of our selves: If we look on du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, as prayer, receiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts carry us as far from the duty in hand, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth are one from another? No holy end we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but many by-ends are thrust in by corruption. Look upon our ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iest action, corruption like a filthy rag hangs on it. <hi>Isai.</hi> 64.6. Many godly men look like a pure fountain, yet as a pure fountain when it's troubled, you shall see abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mud to come up, which makes the water look thick and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ross; so when tentations come, many godly men shew much weakness, as when wrong is offered to them, or when they are to witness matters for Christ that expose them to hardship.</p>
                     <p>So in the use of things indifferent; as apparel, diet, recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas sobriety ought to bound them, together with an aptitude for our Christian calling, commonly mens estates bound them: so that Gods people are oftner over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the abuse of indifferent things, then in committing things in the whole kinde unlawful; and so are oft driven upon vows to abridge themselves, and so fall into snares; for too often vows become snares.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The nature of a sin of infirmity is seen,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that it's of weakness; for the more any sin partakes of the will, the neerer it comes to presumption: if there were strength of Spirit, there would be constancy to hold out, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. especially if together there be light in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:118411:41"/>
                     <p>It's against the univesal purpose of the heart.

Hence some think all the sins of regenerate men are sins of infirmity: such a purpose is wrought in every regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man in the act of conversion.</p>
                     <p>Now for the differences 'twixt Saints infirmities, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mens presumptions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Sins of infirmity, are oft committed of ignorance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther universal or particular, habitual or actual.</p>
                     <p>Now presumptions are against light: sometimes the light of the natural conscience, as in <hi>Pilate, Mar.</hi> 15.10. who when natural conscience cri'd for the acquitment of an innocent person, yet he condemned him to death, for fear he should lose <hi>Caesars</hi> friendship: sometimes light of education, as those that have been brought up in good families, and under godly masters, yet after come to speak evil of the good wayes of God. By how much more clear the light is we go against, the greater is the presumption; as in the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 1. also <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. God cast him off from being King, for forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself against conscience, to offer sacrifice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The infirmities of the Saints, are mostly of passion; as when <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>I shall one day fall by the hands of Saul.</hi> And thus was <hi>Job</hi> impatient, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.1. the temper of his heart was otherwise, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.20, 21. compared with <hi>James</hi> 5.11. see what infirmities <hi>Jeremiah</hi> fell into, <hi>chap.</hi> 20.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. the cause was passion, occasioned, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. by the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> anger for a gourd was a passion.</p>
                     <p>Now the presumptions of natural men, are done with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, as in <hi>Balaam,</hi> many dayes came betwixt <hi>Balaks</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="5">5. Infirmities are against the purpose of a mans heart, as in <hi>Peter, Mar.</hi> 14.29. see how vehement he was, <hi>v.</hi> 31. Any one that sins of infirmity, can say, I have a purpose against every sin,

                     <p>Now wicked men have a purpose for sin in time to come: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> &amp; <hi>Sapphira</hi> had a purpose to reserve their money against all times and hazards, though they profest the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

So <hi>Jobs</hi> conscience for impatiency, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. And <hi>Davids</hi> heart smote him for numbering the people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. When the heart doth smite, and that for small sins: and the sooner it smites, the more it shews our sins are infirmities.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Why Saints believed this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because God hath promised it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, 40. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>All that are in the grave shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because God is powerful to raise them up. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. Against all carnal reasonings, oppose <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. What he hath promised, he is able to perform.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the resurrection of Christ, who rose as a <hi>first-fruits,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20. He was as a head to the body: the members shall not lie under ground always, being the head is above it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From absurdities if there be none, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vain, faith is vain,</hi> vers. 14. the Apostles false witnesses, vers. 15. Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It appears from resemblances in nature; as trees seem dead in Winter, yet revive in the Spring. <hi>Job</hi> 14.7, 8, 9. If it be said, <hi>They were not altogether dead;</hi> Answ. <hi>No more is man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:118411:44"/>
                  <p>Object. <hi>The condition of beasts and men is both one,</hi> Eccles. 3.19. <hi>Now beasts rise not again;</hi> ergo, <hi>not men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks in the person of Atheists. 2. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> saith both are a like in dying, but not both in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition after death: <hi>As the one dieth, so dieth the other:</hi> And when he says, vers. 21. <hi>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward?</hi> (though <hi>Gregory Neocaesariensis</hi> understand this of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that wrote this of himself when he gave himself to pleasures, his thoughts began to be so brutish, that he thought there was one and the same end of man and beast.) Yet I take it, <hi>Solomon</hi> means, that the knowledge, of these things by natural principles is hard to come by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>Inform.</hi> Of our duty to believe that the souls and bodies of men shall one day be new coupled together, either to be rewarded or punished, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. What though Heathens count this doctrine babbling, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18. say that after death is nothing, and that death is immortal? yet we know otherwise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Repr.</hi> Of those who are Sadduces in judgment, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heathens, but Christians in pretence; such as Pope <hi>John</hi> 23. and Pope <hi>Paul</hi> 3. Boldly they say, that you shall never make them believe that the body shall be raised again. Ready are profane persons to put scoffing questions about it; as the Sadduces, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.23. to vers. 31.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Exhort.</hi> Be careful to keep a good conscience, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.15, 16. in hope of it.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But seeing all shall rise again, what differcnce 'twixt Saints and others?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Great will be the difference.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Saints shall rise by vertue of the union with Christ, and the working of that Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. but the wicked by his powerful voice, as he is God, which shall be uttered by the last trump.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Saints shall have a better resurrection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. and shall see God for themselves, <hi>Job</hi> 19.27. tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is, for their good. Wicked men shall see God against themselves, that as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118411:44"/> soon as they look out of their graves, <hi>they shall say, Mountains, fall on us,</hi> Apoc. 6.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They differ in the ends. The Saints shall awake to <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting glory,</hi> but wicked persons to <hi>everlasting misery,</hi> Dan. 12.2. This was resembled in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s servants: the butler was taken out of prison, and restored to his place: so the Saints: but the baker was taken out to be hanged. Wicked men shall be at the resurrection in a disgraceful estate, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and they shall be clogg'd with all misery and want, as <hi>Dives</hi> was, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. Hence the Article of the Resurrection is put between the Article of Remission of sins and Eternal life, to shew that resurrection of the body is then onely a benefit, when remission of sins goes before it, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life follows after it. See the different ends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Exhort.</hi> To Christians, not to be hopeless concerning your selves or friends, when you come to die. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15. What though Heathens say, <hi>Vale spes,</hi> Farewel hope, let not Christians say so. If a man take a long journey, his wife and children do not usually weep, because they expect his return ere long home again: no more let us, in regard of our friends. We Saints, when we die, onely go to a pleasant bed, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57.2. <hi>Job</hi> 3.17. sweetned by Christ's lying down therein first. What though the grave be a prison-house to wicked men? yet it is a store-house to the bodies of Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Exhort.</hi> To all Saints, to believe the resurrection. We stand in need to have our faith strengthned herein. Of this <hi>Paul</hi> had assurance, and speaks of all Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. In d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath, we are not destroyed, but dissolved. Souldiers when they destroy a house, they care not where they fling the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and tyles: but he that dissolves it, takes it down piece by piece, because be means to build with it again. So the Lord he knows where the bodies of men are laid, so that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they be, they are safe. Are the Saints called <hi>The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the resurrection,</hi> Luke 20.36. and shall they not hope for it? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But the difficulty of the resurrection startles my soul.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Hath not God made heaven and earth, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Noah and his family, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly?</hi> brought Israel thorow the Red-sea out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and from Babylon? brought <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the lions den, and <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the whales belly? the three children out of the fiery furnace? the Manna from heaven, and water out of the rock? Why should it be then thought a thing incredible, that God should raise the dead?</p>
                  <p>The second Point from these words, <hi>In my flesh shall I see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> The Saints believe there shall be a resurrection of the same body: <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>In three days I will raise IT up.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>This corruptible</hi> (pointing at his body) <hi>must put on incorruption.</hi> Joh. 11.24. <hi>He shall rise again in the resurrection.</hi> Now <hi>Lazarus</hi> had a body as well as a soul. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>He shall quicken your mortal bodies</hi> by his Spirit: no other but them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.</hi> Job 19.26, 27. <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>In his flesh he should see God, and his eyes should behold him:</hi> he means not the eyes of his soul, nor the eyes of his understanding, because he speaks of his <hi>skin,</hi> of his <hi>flesh,</hi> and his <hi>eyes:</hi> yea, he speaks positively: <hi>I, and I my self: Ego, ipse ego, non alius:</hi> and negatively, or exclusively; <hi>not another,</hi> not a stranger.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Justice of God: It's just that those that have been partakers of good and evil actions, be partakers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments. But the bodies of men are partners with the soul in good and evil actions: it's equal then, that they be raised up, and not a new body. If <hi>Job</hi>'s eyes have wept tears, it's reason the tears be wiped from them, and not from a pair of new-made cheeks. If they have retained themselves from strange objects, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. it's meet they be rewarded with the view of better objects. Shall <hi>Paul</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be scourged, and another for it be glorified? Shall he <hi>bear in his body the marks of the Lord Iesus,</hi> and not bear in the same body the crown of his glory? What comfort were it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118411:45"/> for the body to abridge it self of much pleasure, and to suffer many afflictions, and another strange body shall step up, and come in, and carry away the crown, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.25. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because if the same body were not raised up, it were not a resurrection, but the creation of a new: whereas the fore-named places call it a resurrection. Therefore men are not new made of the four element<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>h believes God will raise up the same body, <hi>idem ens,</hi> the same being in number, the same individual body.</p>

This the learned think not onely a prediction of the deliverance of Israel out of Babylon, but also a typical confirmation of the resurrection of our bodies. Such a comparison could not be deduced from bones, unless the same should happen to bones. Besides, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s rod turned serpent, and his serpent rod: he that restores <hi>Aaron</hi>'s rod that vegeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

At the resurrection of Christ, many bodies of the Saints came out of their graves, and appeared to many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52, 53.</p>

For the age, there is nothing revealed of that: but it's probable our souls shall receive those bodies from which they departed, all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections being done away: but however, every age is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of blessedness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use Consol.</hi> In life and death. In life, we are troubled with many diseases; in death, we apprehend a future rottenness: yet one day shall this body of thine be raised, yea more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then it is for the present. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. the Apostle to the Objection, vers. 10. <hi>You Saints die as well as others,</hi> gives a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consolation: 1. vers. 10. Though <hi>the body be dead, because of sin;</hi> yet <hi>the spirit is life, because of</hi> Christ's <hi>righteousness.</hi> 2. Vers. 11. <hi>The Spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead, will also raise us up.</hi> The head being alive, the body shall not be always dead. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>I will not speak of other comforts, as the present happiness of the soul in death: for the body, this is enough, that God will raise it again. As God said to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 46.4. <hi>I will surely go down with thee into Egypt, and I will bring thee up again,</hi> the same saith he to our bodies, I will go with them to the grave, and bring them back again.</p>

Can the art of man of ashes make cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious glasses, and of rotten rags make white paper? and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the wise God raise up glorious bodies from the dust? What though thou knowst not where the materials be? yet God knows to give to every one their own flesh in the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; not the least limb, vein, or artery shall be wanting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 2. Keep thy body undefiled. What a spectacle wilt thou be before God, Angels, and Men, when those hands that have robb'd, those eyes that have lusted, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118411:47"/> tongue that hath slandered, those ears that have listned after filthiness, shall be raised up in the several abominations?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 3. To see the dead Saints decently intombed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wait for the adoption, the redemption of thy body; groan for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. To do good to the poor, in hope of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.13.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To suffer the cruelties done to thy body, in hope of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35.</p>
                  <p>The thought of the resurrection made <hi>Paul</hi> keep his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science void of offence,</hi> Acts 24.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>As it will be a comfort, that thy members have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for God; so contrarily, what a discomfort, when they have been employed for sin?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Terrour</hi> to all ungodly men, That the same body shall rise again.

                  <p>Object. <hi>But what shall become of the soul in the mean time? shall that sleep in the body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> No, <hi>The spirit returns to God,</hi> Eccles. 12.7. <hi>Dives</hi> soul was in hell, when his brethren were here on earth. <hi>Steven</hi> at his death resigned his soul to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. The thief on the Cross went the same day into Paradise. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. As the devils take a wicked man's soul, the same day he dies, and carries it to hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>This night do they require thy soul of thee:</hi> so the Saints presently go to heaven: <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> as soon as dead, is in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosome.</p>
                  <p>But to speak a little more concerning the souls not dying with the body, because it hath been a great controversie in these times, I shall adde, That the soul dies not with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by these Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace in the Saints is <hi>a continual well of water springing up unto life everlasting,</hi> Joh. 4.14. which could not be, if there were any moment wherein a believer were in soul and body dead: for though it might spring up in future, it could not spring up <hi>in him</hi> at present.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It appears from contraries. If unbelievers die in body onely, and not in soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>This night shall they</hi> (that is, the devils) <hi>require thy soul of thee;</hi> then it follows, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers die onely in body, not in soul. <hi>Dives</hi> was in torments, when his five brethren were here on earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.

                     </gap>ies of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> suffer at present <hi>the vengeance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118411:48"/> of eternal fire.</hi> These histories were long before the day of judgement.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scriptures threaten everlasting destruction on the wicked. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not, the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on him,</hi> for ever: But how can this be truth when a Preacher preacheth it, if they shall be free from torment till the day of judgment?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Scripture tells us of a present enjoyment of our crown: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>If our earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we know we have an eternal house in heaven.</hi> Phil. 1.23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is much better.</hi> As soon as ever he was dissolved, he was with Christ. If he should not have been with Christ till the day of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, it would not have been the better condition to have died, much less the <hi>much better</hi> condition; nay, indeed it had been worse, yea much worse.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Assoon as we are <hi>absent from the body,</hi> we are <hi>present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. Assoon as we are <hi>unclothed,</hi> we are <hi>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed upon with an house from heaven,</hi> v. 2, 4. Assoon as we die, <hi>mortality is swallowed up of life,</hi> as the rivers of the sea, and time Of eternity. Which could not be, if the soul died with the body. Besides, vers. 6. <hi>Whiles we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</hi> Wherein <hi>Paul</hi> shews how long believers are absent from the Lord, even whiles they are at home in the body, and not longer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It appears from the safety of souls departed from the body. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9, 10. Lest the Martyrs should faint because of the bloody face appeared in the ten first persecutions, <hi>John</hi> tells them, The souls of such deceased Martyrs were safe, they were under a defensive shelter, they were under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Christ, who is called a Christians <hi>altar, Heb.</hi> 13.10. The comfort runs thus: Though your bodies perish, yet your souls go to Christ. And withal, the Spirit saith, That <hi>white robes were given unto them;</hi> that is, the crown of glory, wherein was no spot; onely they were to rest for the fulness of their glory, till their fellow-servants were to be crowned.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:118411:49"/>7. The soul dies not with the body, because persecutors, though they <hi>can kill the body,</hi> they <hi>cannot kill the soul,</hi> Matth. 10.28. which they might easily do, yea must necessarily do, if the soul died with the body. But Christ saith expresly, <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul:</hi> where also we see that soul and body are contradistinguished one from another.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The principle of the souls dying with the body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Morality. Were wicked men perswaded that they should be without any feeling of torments till the end of the world, they would do whatsoe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er their inclination led them to: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Because sentence against an evil work is not presently executed, the hearts of the children of men are fully set in them to do evil?</hi> How much more, when this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is deferred to the day of judgement? The Lord's <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of his coming,</hi> made <hi>that evil servant beat his fellow-servants, Matth.</hi> 24.48, 49. Besides, holy mens endeavours would be blunted, when after the race of life is run, they must tarry many days for the prize.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The soul is without matter, and therefore cannot die with the body. Reason tells us, that when all body is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, there remains a substance, a thinker, an <hi>ego;</hi> though liver, lungs, kidneys, tongue, hands, legs, were taken away. Besides, the various answers the soul gives to questions, proves it. Besides, such as the effect is, such is the cause: now there are abundance of immaterial notions in the soul, as concerning God and Angels, the apprehension of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the infinity of capacity, in taking in innumerable objects, without dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing out one another; and the infinity of accessions; all which do openly dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>laim form, quantity, and matter: for what hath quantity, or is a body, cannot admit a new thing unto it, unless some other thing do first go out, to make room for that which comes. Now the more the soul receives, the more it is able to receive. Besides, though the Fancie be the nimblest of all bodily things, yet the Soul in discoursing contains more in it then is in the fancie.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It's a Ruled case in Philosophy, <hi>That the soul of man is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118411:49"/> indivisible.</hi> Brutes are destroyed, by parting their blood from their flesh, or by the evaporation, or quenching of the natural heat: but the soul is indivisible, and cannot admit of any quantitative parts; and therefore cannot be mortal.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If the soul should die with the body, it would die by degrees, a man's Reason and abilities would be less and less. But we see, when the body is exceeding weak, the soul is so active, that it can order a kingdom, speaks often to astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of by-standers. If any soul's abi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ities fail, it is for want of an organ; as when the brain is hurt, the soul cannot exercise its actions: but if it receive a sound organ, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the same acts and operations it did before; which proves that the soul remains unchangeable in it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f. When the soul and body are at the point departure, or point of death, could the body recover it self, the soul would be the same it was.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. It appears from the distinct actions of soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that the soul dies not with the body. The one is sick, the other well; the one present, the other absent; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in bed, the soul in <hi>America,</hi> and in a moment it comes from thence to <hi>Euro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> from thence to heaven: the one weeps, the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aughs. How shall the same thing be in a million of places at once? yet so is the Sun, when a million of people think of it. How can the quantity of the heavens be shut up in the quantity of a man's brain? How can place and time past be removed in another place, and another time, when in the mean time the body remains one and the same, in one place, and one time? Now all this proves, besides the immateriality of the soul, the distinct actions of soul and body.</p>
                  <p>Yet I will not deny, but that there are some passages of Scripture that seem to hold out, as if the soul no more then body were to have any crown till the day of the resurrection; as, <hi>Job</hi> 14.12. <hi>Man l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eth down, and riseth not till the heavens be no more: they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. there's <hi>a crown which the Lord shall give AT THAT DAY, to all that love his appearing.</hi> By <hi>that day,</hi> he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118411:50"/> means the day of judgement: 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6. <hi>God will render tribulation to them that trouble Saints, and rest to Saints:</hi> But when? even <hi>when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels.</hi> Heb. 11.39. <hi>They without us shall not be perfect.</hi> Besides, the reward or punishment seems often to be respited to the coming of Christ. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. <hi>When Christ shall appear, we shall appear with him in glory.</hi> Also, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These and many other places must be expounded of the crown in fulness, not of a total delay of reward or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till that day, being the far more plain places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture seem to urge so much: though I must needs confess, that divers of the Fathers (as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> against <hi>Tripho,</hi> and others) were of this opinion, that the souls come not into blessedness till the day of the resurrection.</p>

                     <hi>Defin.</hi> Excommunication is an action of the Church, made by the authority, and in the name of Christ; whereby the Church, according to the form prescribed Christ, separates a wicked brother from the fellowship of the faithful, especially in those things which concern the worship of God: and that for the salvation of the party excommunicated, and the good of the Church, and glory of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p>About which, consider two things: 1. The form of it. 2. What it contains. The form of it consists in four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:118411:52"/>1. In a particular declaring of the wickedness of that man that hath refused all admonitions, or committed some enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crime.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In calling upon the name of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> the power of Christ to this action, as it's expounded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In delivering the excommunicated person to Satan, <hi>i. e.</hi> declaring him to be under the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In cutting off the excommunicated person from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, as a rotten member whom all ought to shun, 2 <hi>John</hi> 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In publick prayers to confirm the excommunication, that the excommunicated person may feel the severe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in himself. And lest the Church should be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in proceeding, or stubborn men despise it, Christ shews, <hi>à minori,</hi> that if two of them with consent shall ask any thing of the Father, they shall obtain it, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. how much more shall the whole Church, binding and delivering an impenitent sinner? If two can obtain any thing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>John</hi> 14.13, 16, 23. much more many can obtain this thing. Nay, for further ratification, it shall notonely be established of my Father, but <hi>I,</hi> my self, <hi>will be present in the midst,</hi> as the chief Judge of the Church to ratifie the sentence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What excommunication contains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A pronouncing of an impenitent person, (whom the Church for his stubbornness deems to be separate from Communion with Christ) to be bound in the hands of Satan, and to be separate from outward Communion with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. As in the Law the Priests censure of the leper, declared him to be infected.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It separates from inward Communion with Christ: but this it doth onely on condition of final and obstinate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, yea, if an elect person should be cast our, as it may so fall out, should they fall as <hi>David</hi> did; though they cannot be separate wholly from a life of grace, yet may they be separate from a life of comfort: <hi>ex gr.</hi> when the finger is by some cut separated in part from the hand, it hath some nourishment from the hand, lest it die altogether; yet
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118411:52"/> not so much as before, when it was whole, joyned to the hand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It contains a binding of sin upon the sinners consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Whatsoever thou shalt binde on earth;</hi> not onely <hi>whomsoever,</hi> but <hi>whatsoever:</hi> so that if godly, his heart is for present more void of comfort; if wicked, he becomes more hardned in sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Use Exhort.</hi> to Churches, To binde and loose onely such persons whom God binds and looses in heaven.</p>
                  <p>But the Church may say, <hi>How shall we do this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That you may do this as God would have, Look there be
<list>
                        <item>1. Right ends.</item>
                        <item>2. A right ground to binde or loose.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Right ends; as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The good of the party excommunicate; as, that the flesh may be tamed, the old man killed, and the new man quickned, and so the soul saved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>in the day of the Lord Jesus,</hi> that is, at the day of judgement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To bridle men that are wicked in doctrine and practice, lest they <hi>leaven the whole lump.</hi> Gal. 5.9. 1 Cor. 5.6. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> calls it. The separating the rotten sheep from the sound, <hi>de Correp. &amp; Gratiâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lest the Church should bear the punishment, for suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one wicked person; as in <hi>Achan,</hi> Josh. 7. and in <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> Apoc. 2.14. and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> vers. 20. for <hi>Jezebel.</hi> As the Physitian is not cruel, if he cut off a leg, that the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be preserved; no more is the Church cruel in cutting off a rotten member for the safety of the whole Church. The Mariners were punished for not casting out <hi>Jonah,</hi> Israel for not ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ing out <hi>Achan,</hi> the Benjamites for not punishing those that ravished the Levite's concubine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Church may be well reported of, whiles she will not suffer such persons or sins. As <hi>the Name of God is blasphemed</hi> when we sin; so when we condemn sin, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the sinner, by casting him out, <hi>God is glorified.</hi> As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of Prophecie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. so unbelievers, when they see wicked men are not suffered in the Church, are edified.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:118411:53"/>5. That the severity of this Censure may deter men from sinning. As <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.11. so I. For as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the family puts and shuts out of doors untractable servants and children, not that they may perish with cold or hunger, but that they may be reformed in their maners, and so return in again; and other servants and children be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their example: so doth the Church. And truely, if the Church forbear to take it into their hands, God is wont to punish it more severely.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the sinner may have an inward communion with God. This power is not given to the Church for any mans ruine, but for edification: not for to make it a money-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being glad when a sin is committed, that they may have a sacrifice, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.8. but that the soul by repentance may come to have inward communion with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Censures be administred upon a right ground.</p>
                  <p>This must be looked to,
<list>
                        <item>1. In Excommunication.</item>
                        <item>2. In Absolution.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Excommunication: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Living in a purpose of sin. Though this be hard to know, yet by a frequent repetition of the same sin, God may give such an intimation, that the Church may go on in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Notorious sins are thus to be punished; as heresie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But here's nothing but</hi> reject <hi>him, after the first or second admonition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The reason is, because the offence of Heresie is publike, and therefore there needs no private admonition. Many Copies read, <hi>After the first admonition, reject;</hi> meaning the admonition of the Church, or of the Elders therein, whereof <hi>Titus</hi> was one. Now that such Hereticks are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, appears, because t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ey censure themselves; they are condemned of themselves: for Hereticks commonly preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the judgement of the Church, separate themselves stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from the communion of the faithful. Others are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly cast out of the Church, but Hereticks separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118411:53"/> Excommumcation being a certain condemnation, as the Fathers call it, a certain anticipation of eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the highest fore-judging of the great judgement; it follows that an Heretick separating himself thus, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn himself. For those Hereticks that thus condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, there needs no further censure from others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For all notorious sins, as incest, whoredom, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, idolatry, contempt of Ordinances, contentions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. in a word, for all those sins the Apostle excludes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners out of heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5, 6. especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. If we may not eat with such, (as some think, and I querie) much less may we eat the Lords Supper with such. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But what if the sinner say he repents, and be sorry? as in case of adultery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not enough to say so, but there must be such a repentance as is described <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.12. by sighs, humble deportment, or tears. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have the incestuous person received, till he shewed manifest sorrow. Antichrist teaches, that it is enough to receiving into grace, if a man say he is sory for his sins, and that he will amend his life.</p>
                  <p>Yea, though there were never such an humble deportment when persons are so overtaken, the Censure of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation must proceed against such; because, 1. Those tears and humiliations may come from the reproach of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, not for grieving such a Father. 2. That the Church may clear their hands of the evil. 3. That they may see whether it be a true repentance, by the continuedness of it, or onely but for a fit. Onely the Church must have a care that the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be not swallowed up of over-much sorrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Censure of Absolution is to be administred after the sinner hath lain some convenient space of time under the Censure; as three, four, five, or six months, according as there is just occasion. <hi>Theodosius</hi> after eight months was received of <hi>Ambrose.

                  <p n="1">1. The Church commanded them to remain a certain while in the state of repentance, in which they might bewail their sins, and mortifie their flesh, and be attentive to the Word preached, and be instant with God in prayer. And this was no other thing then was done with the incestuous person.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their life being tried, they made a publike confession both of their life and their offence, and of their faith. Which is no other thing then ought to be done now, that persons mournfully confess their sins, and their saith in Christ for the pardon of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When their repentance was evident, the Bishop with his C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There was another way of receiving penitents, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Schitlerus, de potestate Clavium. Anno</hi> 265. an Order was set down, by <hi>Gregory Ponticus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Neocaesaria,</hi> and the Ecclesiastical Synod, as appears out of the history of the Synod of <hi>Antioch</hi> assembled against <hi>Samosetanus.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. They were admitted to hearing within the Temple, in a certain place behinde the <hi>Catechumeni;</hi> they did not go further in, as being unworthy to be present at the prayers of the godly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They came in fight of the Church, and stood among the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and went out with them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They stood among the faithful.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They were admitted to the Church-communion.</p>
                  <p>We see somethings were brought in by men; yet still they held the substance, that persons cast out, 1. Should be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time in a state of ejection. 2. That they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in without humiliation.</p>
                  <p>There was a practice not much unlike, observed in the Church of <hi>Rome, Tripart. hist. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 35.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There was a certain place where they made their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The penitents, when the Ordinances were done, not receiving the Communion, cast themselves on the earth with weeping and mourning, with whom the Bishop and common people wept.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Bishop prayed for the penitent according to the occasion, and so dismisses the Congregation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The penitents of their own accord afflicted themselvs after, by fasting, or other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that excommunicate persons, when they shew signes of their faith, repentance, and purpose of new life, and with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118411:55"/> bleeding hearts promise amendment, publikely, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again into the Churches fellowship, with the greatest gentleness and good-will.</p>
                  <p>Now for the maner of receiving such a person, let the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the name of the Church propose these Questions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether he confess the crime for which he was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether he think himself justly punished.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether he be heartily sorry for the offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether he desire forgiveness of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whether he have a purpose to mend his life, to war a good warfare, to hold the faith in a good conscience.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whether he would have the Church, whom he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to pray for him.</p>
                  <p>After which, let the Pastor adde a grave Exhortation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods wrath against sin, both in punishments tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal; of the danger of Scandal; of the frailty of man's nature; of true repentance; of free pardon in Christs blood; of the loving affections God's people ought to shew with gladness to a person repenting; of the gentleness the Church ought to shew, <hi>considering they also may be tempted,</hi> Gal. 6.1. with a desire to the brethren to shew all gentleness to this poor soul, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for the incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person.</p>
                  <p>Now the brethrens duties to a poor penitent soul, are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>set him in joynt</hi> again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. To <hi>confirm their love towards him,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.8. that is, to have as firm a love towards him, as if he had not fallen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing to be lookt at, is, That there be a right power: for though a man deserved to be hanged, yet would persons be careful, that it be done by a due power: and this power is partly in the brethren, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. they had liberty to joyne with the sounder part of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to bring those teachers that troubled them with justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118411:55"/> by works to publick censure; and the Elders both to examine the matter before, and after judicially to sentence. There is an ordinary similitude of the Jury and Judge that expresses it: when the Jury give in their verdict, yet is not the offender condemned or executed without the Judge: no more, as some think, where there are Elders, is the sinner cast out upon the discerning censure of the brethren; but upon the judicial censure of the Elders, wherein the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren also binde and loose by consenting thereto, and after by withdrawment of Communion; but where there are no Elders, the power is in the Church. Neither is this other then was in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, who writes to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> That <hi>he had laboured much with the common people, that peace might be given to those that were fallen:</hi> which if he could have given himself, he would not have wearied himself so in perswading the people. So <hi>Augustine</hi> against the <hi>Donatists, We must then cease from excommunication, when all the people are infected with the same fault, because,</hi> saith he, <hi>they will not agree to the excommunication, but will defend him whom thou shalt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.</hi> By which he shews, excommunication was not wont to be done without the consent of the brethren.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Again, those things which belong to all, ought not to be done without the consent of all, said Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> Now what more belongs to the whole Church, then to cut off a member from the body?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The release of this censure is ascribed in the same word of forgiveness unto the Church, as unto <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <gap reason="foreign">

Christ would have those that would neither be healed with private admonition, nor wiTh admonition before two witnesses, to be brought to the Church. As the fault grows, so Christ would have the number of them, before whom, and of whom he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, to grow.</p>

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:118411:56"/>2. Christ speaks in the plural number, <hi>Whatsoever sins ye binde:</hi> therefore one Bishop cannot be the person binding.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The censure inflicted on the incestuous, was done by more, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this dishonour was inflicted by more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. therefore not by one Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Paul alone did excommunicate the incestuous person; therefore the Bishop may do so.</hi>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It's denied the Bishop may do what the Apostle could.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apostle onely as a penman of the Sccripture goes before them in his Apostolike duty, shewing them the way they should go, taking nothing from those commands, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> and <hi>Whatsoever ye shall bind;</hi> he saith nor, I have delivered him to Satan; but, <hi>let him delivered by you to Satan, and purged out by you, and put away by you,</hi> vers. 13. If the Ministers of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> with the rest of the body, had not purged him from the Church, although he had been worthy to have been call out, yet had be not been cast out.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But what if the brethren will not consent, that one that is contumacious against the Church, and manifestly wicked, should be cast out?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. A consociation of Churches is necessary, that the brethren that stand off, may present their reasons to be scan'd; and because in multitude of Counsellors is safety in difficult cases, as in the election &amp; ordination of Elders, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of an Elder, or any other eminent person, it's good to proceed with common consultation and consent; so we see the Apostles consulting one with another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. And the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem, Acts</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That this binding and loosing be done in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there be a consultation with other Churches, in difficult &amp; intricate cases; as a wise Chirurgion doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the cutting off an hand or an arm, unless be have the judgement of other Chirurgions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Chirurgion seldom proceeds to the cutting off a member, and scaring of it, before he first tries all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118411:56"/> and oft he perceives it better not to cut it off, then thereby to hazard the health of the patient: so ought the Churches, rather to contain themselves within the bounds of admonitions, exhortations and threats, then to proceed to cutting off, if it may be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there be no remedy, but that they must proceed to cutting off, then ought they to do it with great grief and sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, as if they were going to cut off one of their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> when he was to subscribe to the death of any condemned person, was wont to say, <hi>Utinam literas nescirem! I would I were ignorant of letters!</hi> If these dispositions were in men, they would be more careful in denouncing this sentence. A certain foolish Suffragan (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> relates the story) did degrade a certain Priest who was to be burned because he had preached Gods truth. The Suffragan said he would separate the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr both from the Militant and Triumphant Church of Christ. To whom the Martyr wisely and constantly answered, <hi>Why dost thou say thou wilt separate me from the militant and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Church of Christ? There's no creature can pull me from thence; and thou dost in vain endeavour to cut me off from the body of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That you withdraw your company and communion from such a person so cut off: <hi>let him be an heathen,</hi> with whom the Jews had no religious communion; <hi>or as a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,</hi> with whom the Jews had no civil communion, as some think.</p>
                  <p>Yet in case they be persons to whom we are bound by the law of Nature, as wives to husbands, children to parents, though excommunicate, we may converse with them in civil, though not in religious communion: onely take heed, lest in conversing with them ye bolster them up in any sinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For others, where there is no such relation, some think we are <hi>not to eat with them,</hi> nor <hi>bid them God-speed.</hi> Yet must we not cease to reach and admonish them, yea, if in want, to relieve them, because Excommunication mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118411:57"/> excommunicate to be feared: for if he justly weigh what is done against him, he may see it proceeds from charity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That when such a sinner repents, you be not so severe against him for his sin, that you suffer him to be swallowed up of too much sorrow, (as it seems the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were too eager against the incestuous, that the Apostle was fain to write to them to receive him) but use all gentleness towards him, and shew all gladness for his recovery. Shall there be joy among the Angels for the repentance of sinners, and shall not we be glad hereat?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Exhort.</hi> To such sinners as are bound under the Censure of the Church, That they shew their unfeigned repentance, that the Church may release them from that severe Censure.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It should be a great grief to a holy heart, to have Gods people to think ill, much more to separate them from their communion in a Church-way: it so afflicted the incestuous, that he could never have peace till he was taken in. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> saith, <hi>Excommunication is a greater punishment, then if a man were executed by sword, fire, and wilde beasts.</hi> A man is more pitifully bound with the Churches keys, then with iron or adamantine manacles. <hi>Cart. annot. Rhem. Test. in Matth.</hi> 18.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If in case of private wrongs we are bound to give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. how much more when a Church is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended? O despise not the Church! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. <hi>What they binde on earth, is bound in heaven,</hi> Mat. 18.18. It is a most sad punishment, for any person to go out of the world, &amp; to have the just censure of a Church lying upon him. Thou canst have no assurance of the pardon of thy sins, till thou hast repented, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. Now thy repentance, if it be right, it must be for publike sins publikely.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When thou hast been justly censured, and hast not made thy peace with the Church, thou art, for any thing we know, in no better case then under Satan's clutches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But to deliver men to Satan, is nothing but to deliver men to be tormented of Satan: therefore no Church-censure is meant in that place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:118411:57"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is one thing to deliver to Satan, another thing that which followed this delivery.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To deliver to Satan, is to declare a man, whom the Church deems to be a slave of Satan, for his impenitencie, to be no more a member of the Church, but a slave of Satan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which followed this delivery to Satan, was, to be afflicted with diseases; as <hi>Miriam,</hi> when she was put out of the Camp for slandering <hi>Moses,</hi> was smitten with leprosie, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.10. and <hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. Sometimes the excommunicate person was tormented by Satan: so when <hi>Ambrose</hi> had excommunicated the Scribe of the Emp. <hi>Stili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> by name, God delivered over the Scribe to the spirit of Satan to vex him. Sometimes they have horrour of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby God declares the establishment of that in heaven, which is done upon earth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So far as man can judge, thou art no better then an Heathen or a Publicane, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. Thou tremblest to be in such a condition, yet doth the Church of Christ look on thee in no better condition; yea, if it be possible, in a worse, because thou sinst against the light they never had.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>I would make my peace with the Church, but onely for shame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It's a great sin in those that shall deride any that shall be humbled in this case, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. Further: it's no shame: for hereby thou publishest not thy sin, which is the onely true cause of shame; but thy repentance, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable. All Saints will bless God for thy repentance, though some leud persons should scoff. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.24. 2. Who thinks worse of <hi>Myriam,</hi> of the incestuous person? <hi>He that thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himself, shall be exalted,</hi> Matth. 23.12. 3. Suppose hereby thou shouldst lose thy credit for ever, yet art thou bound to prefer thy duty before thy credit. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. The parents of the blinde man would not do their duty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christ, for fear of being cast out of the Synagogue, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.21, 22. but the blinde man would follow the dictate of his own conscience, though he were cast out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.32, 33.</p>

If persons do not shew fruits of repentance, it appears they have not repented, though they say they have repented. The incestuous person was not received in, till he shewed mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest signes of repentance.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>What are the publick signes of repentance, wherewith the Church may rest satisfied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. An holy shunning of all sins, by an unspotted life, and in particular the sin for which he was cast out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A desire of reconciliation with the Church, with a trembling to remain out of Communion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A sorrowful bewailing for all his sins: in particular, for the sins for which he was cast out, accompanied at least with a dejected countenance, if not with tears, with a promise of humble obedience; aggravation of sin, &amp; self-condemnation being joyned herewith. We read not that the incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shed a tear, but yet he was full of sorrow; but to weep for other things, and not to weep for so great an evil, doth not declare a good pulse of soul.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>Whether is it in the power of the Church to receive a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent into their Communion, which been justly cast out of another Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes: 1. For such a person is in the condition of an Heathen and a Publican. Now may not any Church receive an Heathen, in case he repent of his his heathenism, and embrace the faith of Christ? It is the power of such an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to chuse to what congregation he will joyne; provided he can orderly reside with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Divers mischiefs would follow, if one Church might not absolve those another Church casts out.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For then if a Church should dissolve after they had cast out a sinner, (as among all Judgements, both of Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118411:59"/> Independent and Baptist, it sometimes falls out) the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner should never be absolved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Church should remove a thousand miles from the penitent, or he from them, he must be forced to take that pilgrimage, or else he must not be released, and so be still in scruple of conscience of being bound in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or in case the Elders should pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When the Jews cast out the blinde man, Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sent him to that Church to be absolved, but Christ freely received him.</p>
                  <p>But forasmuch as <hi>God is a God of order, and not of confusion,</hi> therefore, where it may with conveniencie, by the rule of Order, those that have cast out, are to receive in, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church: provided there hath been a just proceeding by the Church or Elders; for else there may happen to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and emulation, in stead of consociation and union among Churches.</p>
